# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will containerize the Mon-Reader application using Docker to enable consistent deployment across different environments. The application consists of a FastAPI backend that provides OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and TTS (Text-to-Speech) services, along with a static frontend for user interaction. The dockerization will include separate containers for the backend and frontend, with proper networking, volume management, and environment configuration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to containerize the Mon-Reader application using Docker, so that I can deploy it consistently across different environments without dependency conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is containerized THEN the backend SHALL run in a separate Docker container with all Python dependencies installed
2. WHEN the application is containerized THEN the frontend SHALL be served through a web server container (nginx) for production-ready deployment
3. WHEN containers are started THEN they SHALL communicate with each other through a Docker network
4. WHEN the application runs in containers THEN it SHALL maintain the same functionality as the non-containerized version

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want Docker Compose configuration for the application, so that I can easily orchestrate multiple containers and manage their dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Docker Compose is used THEN it SHALL define services for both backend and frontend containers
2. WHEN services are defined THEN they SHALL include proper networking configuration for inter-service communication
3. WHEN containers are started THEN persistent volumes SHALL be mounted for uploads and audio outputs
4. WHEN environment variables are needed THEN they SHALL be properly configured through Docker Compose

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper volume management for the containerized application, so that uploaded files and generated audio persist across container restarts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN containers are restarted THEN uploaded images SHALL persist in a Docker volume
2. WHEN containers are restarted THEN generated audio files SHALL persist in a Docker volume
3. WHEN volumes are mounted THEN proper file permissions SHALL be maintained for read/write operations
4. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL have access to required directories for file operations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want environment-specific configuration for the containerized application, so that I can run it in development, staging, and production environments with appropriate settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs in containers THEN API keys SHALL be securely passed through environment variables
2. WHEN different environments are used THEN configuration SHALL be easily adjustable through environment files
3. WHEN containers start THEN they SHALL validate required environment variables are present
4. IF required environment variables are missing THEN the application SHALL fail gracefully with clear error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the containerized application to be accessible through standard web ports, so that I can access the Mon-Reader interface without complex port configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the frontend SHALL be accessible on port 80 (HTTP)
2. WHEN the backend API is accessed THEN it SHALL be available through the frontend proxy or on a designated port
3. WHEN containers are running THEN port mapping SHALL be configured to allow external access
4. WHEN multiple instances are deployed THEN port conflicts SHALL be avoided through proper configuration

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized Docker images for the application, so that build times are minimized and image sizes are kept reasonable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Docker images are built THEN they SHALL use multi-stage builds where appropriate to reduce final image size
2. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN Docker layer caching SHALL be optimized to speed up subsequent builds
3. WHEN images are created THEN they SHALL include only necessary files and dependencies
4. WHEN base images are selected THEN they SHALL be appropriate for the application requirements (Python for backend, nginx for frontend)

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want health checks configured for the containerized services, so that I can monitor service availability and enable automatic restart policies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN containers are running THEN health checks SHALL be configured to verify service availability
2. WHEN a service becomes unhealthy THEN Docker SHALL be able to restart the container automatically
3. WHEN health checks run THEN they SHALL not significantly impact application performance
4. WHEN services are starting THEN health checks SHALL allow adequate time for initialization

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation for building and running the containerized application, so that other team members can easily work with the Docker setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Docker files are created THEN they SHALL include clear comments explaining each step
2. WHEN the setup is documented THEN it SHALL include instructions for building and running containers
3. WHEN environment configuration is needed THEN examples SHALL be provided for required environment variables
4. WHEN troubleshooting is needed THEN common issues and solutions SHALL be documented
